<p>This package contains a selection of classes that are helpful when constructing
a View object. They are called in the construction of many Views, both summary
and full views. They are in this single package to prevent duplication.<br>
</p>
<p>The guideline for adding things to this package is that if a coder notices
code being duplucated between several Views, that code should be examined
for refactoring into some helper or factory class, and out here.</p>
