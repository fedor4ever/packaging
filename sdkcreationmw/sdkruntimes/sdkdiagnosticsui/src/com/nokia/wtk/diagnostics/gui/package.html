<p>This package creates the main window for Diagnostics. It also contains
the Commands object with all command actions which need to be shared amongst
various pieces, and two special listeners for Save and Edit commands in menus.<br>
</p>
<p>The menu listeners are both derived from SlowInstanceMenuListener. This
menu listener, coded to be attached to both JMenu and JPopupMenu objects,
will execute doWillBeVisible() just when the JMenu or JPopupMenu will become
visible. Both derived listeners, SaveMenuListener and EMSMenuListener implement
this call to first examine which object the menu is being called on (which
object is selected) and then examine whether the object has calls in it that
are relevant for saving or doing a cut/copy/paste. If so, these calls are
set properly within the menu. MainWindow attaches thse menu-listener to the
menu it creates in the top toolbar.<br>
</p>
MainWindow creates all the Views by repeatedly implementing the AbstractViewFactoryInterface,
once for every view, in createContentPane(), and passing object with that
interface to ViewPanel to make a view. This implementation of AbstractViewFactoryInterface
is the class PropertyLinkedPanelsFactory. An object of PropertyLinkedPanelsFactory
is instantiated with a specific key of the type String. This key resolves
to several properties in the MainWindows.properties file, and PropertyLinkedPanelsFactory
uses these properties as the values for what classes to use to show the summary
view and the expanded view, and what title to set.
