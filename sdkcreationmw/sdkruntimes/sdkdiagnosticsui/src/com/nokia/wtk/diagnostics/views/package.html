<p>The package that collects all classes related to the View and the management 
of Views.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>Views have an expanded and a summary (collapsed) state. Views are implemented 
as a tuple of a Panel for the expanded state and a Panel for the collapsed 
state, managed by a ViewPanel that shows the correct Panel when necessary. 
The ViewPanel objects also handles showing proper decorations around and resizing-handles.
These ViewPanel objects are held together in the ViewsManager. The ViewsManager
exports a JContainer that a program can put in their main window to show
all the Views.</p>
 
<p><b>To use Views in a program</b><br>
 &nbsp; A program that wants to use the Views system needs to<br>
 </p>
 
<ol>
   <li>For every view that needs to be created, create an object that implements 
AbstractViewFactoryInterface. This interface defines how the expanded and 
the summary view belong together.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Pass this AbstractFactoryViewInterface object to ViewPanel, and ViewPanel 
will instantiate properly.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Add this new ViewPanel to the ViewsManager. ViewsManager will return 
and object that implements in the interface ViewsManager.ViewState so you 
can find out if a View is expanded or collapsed and what the ViewPanel was 
that actually got added.</li>
 
</ol>
<p>AbstractViewFactoryInterface actually does not want a JComponent directly
for the expanded state pf the view, it expects an object implementing ViewAndControlsInterface.
&nbsp;ViewAndControlsInterface has a call to get the JComponent that makes
up the expanded state of the view, getPodContent() which may not return null,
but also two other calls for the controls that appear in the top line of
a View in its expanded state. Either one of these two calls can return null,
and, if so, the ViewPanel will be able to deal with that.<br>
</p>
<p><b>To set the look for Views</b><br>
ViewPanel does all the decoration for the Views, ViewsManager does nothing.
ViewPanel reads in which decoration to use from resources/ViewPanel.properties.
The corners of a ViewPanel are simple gif images in a JPanel that the ViewPanel
put on each corner, the borders are repetitions of gif images in a JPanel
that the ViewPanel puts on the sides. The width or height of these borders
depends on the width or height of the images in the corners.<br>
