 * <p>Title: FileSystemAdapter</p>
 * <p>Description: Specifies the APIs bewteen the SDK and an adapter object for
 *  File system events.
 *  For this simple implementation of the diagnostics adapter, the interface
 *  just extends the DeviceFileSystemListener interface with no additions.
 *  However, this doesn't have to be the case: DeviceFileSystemListener is
 *  the interface to the Diagnostics component itself, while FileSystemAdapter
 *  is the interface between the SDK and the diagnostics adapter. The two interfaces
 *  may be different. </p>
 * <p>Company: Nokia</p>
