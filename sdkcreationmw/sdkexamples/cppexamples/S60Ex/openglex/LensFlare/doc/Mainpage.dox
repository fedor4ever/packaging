 * \section intro_sec 1. About this Example
 *
 *  This example shows how to create a lens flare effect. Lens flare is the result of bright
 *  light refraction in the camera lens.
 *
 *  This example can be extended to any kind of OpenGL ES application, but you might
 *  want to look at the other example applications as well for how to use other,
 *  different kinds of, OpenGL ES features.
 *
 *  Only classes used by this example are the basic UI framework baseclasses. Open GL ES itself is pure C
 *  method call API and doesn't use classes.
 *

 *
 * \section Pre_sec 2. Prerequisites
 *   To build and run this example you need to have the S60 SDK installed and working correctly on your computer.
 *   You also need basic understanding on how to build S60 applications.
 *
 *   To work with this example application you need basic understanding on how to build S60 applications and
 *   basic undestanding of how Symbian (or COE) UI and application framework works. Also basic knowledge on
 *   OpenGL or OpenGL ES is required if you wish to modify the example.

 *
 *  \section Desing_sec 3. Desing and Implemention
 *
 *  The class CLensFlareEffect used in this example is
 *  defined in Utils/utils.h and implemented in Utils/utils.cpp. To produce a lens flare effect,
 *  this example uses a lens flare vector, which is a 2D vector that goes from the screen’s center
 *  to the light’s position. This vector is used to position the different parts of the lens flare.
 *
 *  \subsection Sub31 3.1 Capabilities
 *
 *  The application has only NONE capability as it only needs the rights to execute and access to the screen.
 *
 *  \subsection Sub32 3.2 ScalabaleUI
 *
 *  All Open GL ES examples support various screen modes. The examples also support changing the screen size while the
 *  application is running.
